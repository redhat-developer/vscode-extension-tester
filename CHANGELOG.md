### Breaking changes

- `ExTester` API has been revamped:
  - the 'telescope' argument pattern has been replaced with interfaces using optional parameters
  - methods with lots of arguments `(arg1, arg2, arg3...)` replaced with `({argX: value,...})` so you don't need to type out every argument in the correct order
  - check out the readme and the wiki for more info on migrating to 4.x

### Fixes and improvements

- notifications with types other than `info` should now be correctly recognized
- dissmiss notification will now wait for the button to appear before trying to click it
- `--mocha_config` CLI flag now correctly displays it wants a value
- removed dependency on a github repo, should help with running behind a proxy

### New Features

- tree items now have a `getTooltip` method, returns the contents of the tooltip that appears on hover
- `TextEditor` now has `getCoordinates` method (technically it is now made public), returns coordinates as `[x, y]` number array
- `TreeItem#hasChildren` now actually checks if the item has children (not just if it is expandable, because there are expandable items without children)
- `TreeItem` now has `isExpandable` method, that just checks if the item can be expanded (basically what `hasChildren` used to do)

## 3.2.6 (Feb 10)

- now compatible with vscode 1.53
- navigating through the top menu now waits for the whole context menu to load before clicking, slower but more robust
- searching for a setting in the settings editor now also waits for the page to finish loading
- simple file dialog should now be less likely to randomly 'correct' the file path on confirm
- fixed wrong file name with the vscode-insiders archive
- screenshot capture file names have been sanitized, should no longer error when your test cases contain certain characters

## 3.2.5 (Jan 20)

- error message is now included in the log when screenshot capture fails
- tentative fix for `unknown error: DevToolsActivePort file doesn't exist` on launch
- new page object `ModalDialog`, handles custom style modal dialogs (accessible from vscode 1.50.0 onward via a setting)

## 3.2.4

- fix URL for vscode version check

## 3.2.3 + Page Objects 1.3.0 (Nov 30)

- `runTests` and `setupAndRun` methods from `ExTester` API now properly wait for mocha to finish running before resolving
- `runTests` and `setupAndRun` now return mocha's exit code instead of void
- `ExtensionViewItem#install` now by default waits for the installation to finish before resolving
  - timeout can be passed as argument
  - passing in a zero timeout will skip the wait
- `Menu#select` will now wait for the appropriate menu item to be enabled before clicking it
  - this should fix some menus getting stuck after an item is clicked, with no effect
- `InputBox` should now properly type in paths into Simple file dialog on unix systems
  - if confirming the dialog doesn't in fact confirm it, make sure to use paths that end with a trailing path separator
- `DialogHandler#getOpenDialog` now has a variable delay to wait before trying to get the native dialog
  - note this is still a hard wait, this change is meant to give some people the ability to use longer waits on slower machines

## 3.2.2 + Page Objects 1.2.5 (Oct 29)

- webdriver logs are now collected and saved by default to your test resource folder as `test.log`
  - default log level is INFO
  - use the `-l` or `--log_level <level>` option to change the logging level
- notifications are now constructed directly from a `WebElement` instance, so they are no longer bound by notification's index
  - this changes the notifications' constructors, but hopefully nobody has been using those anyway
- increased the required versions for submodules to their latest, so it should enforce their update as well when updating the main module

## 3.2.1 + Page Objects 1.2.3 (Oct 6)

- not using yarn flag `-y` for setup now automatically adds `--no-yarn` flag to `vsce package` step

- fixed terminal view locators for vscode 1.49
- the abstract `Editor` class is now also available in the API
- `getFileUri` method added to `TextEditor` in case you need a URI, not just a path
- `toggleAllQuickPicks` method added to `Input` boxes
  - use to select/deselect all quick picks when multi-selection is enabled

## 3.2.0 + Page Objects 1.2.2 (Aug 24)

- added a new CLI command and an API method to install extensions from marketplace by id
  - `install-from-marketplace id1 id2 ...` from CLI
  - `installFromMarketplace('id')` from `ExTester` API
- updated page objects to work with vscode 1.48.x (mainly SCM view)
  - note that sections in Extensions view have changed their titles

## Page Objects 1.2.1 (Jul 28)

- fixed a few issues related to tree items in the side bar view
  - fixed `getChildItems` always searching for children of the first item with a given name, rather than the one it's been called from
  - `getLabel` now properly return the actual label of the tree item and as such **is now async**
  - TreeSection `openItem` should no longer fail when recursively expanding tree items
  - tree items constructors now take a `WebElement` as their first argument, instead of a `string` (but noone calls those directly anyway)

## 3.1.0 + Page Objects 1.2.0 (Jul 14)

- The backwards compatibility support is being changed:
  - only the latest 5 minor versions of vscode are now being supported and tested
  - older version will still most likely work, but no further effort will be invested into them

  - a new implementation of SCM View is now available
- basic support for input boxes with title bars

  - **Title retrieval now works properly when the title changes**
  - **Editor#getTitle is now async, returns Promise<string>**

- Added `findQuickPick` method to `Input` objects
  - use to scroll through a quick pick list to a given label/index
  - returns `Promise<QuickPickItem>`
- `Input#selectQuickPick` now scrolls through the list if the given label/index item is not visible
- Check out the PageObjects wiki page for more info

## 3.0.1 (May 20)

- This was supposed to be part of 3.0.0, but I didn't notice the problem (sorry about that)
- **Breaking:**
  - **Native module is no longer re-exported by the main module**
  - **To use native handlers, import the corresponding types directly from vscode-extension-tester-native**
  - **You now officially don't need the native module to compile**

## 3.0.0 (May 6)

### Changes

- extension tester has been split into modules:
  - main module `vscode-extension-tester`
  - page objects `monaco-page-objects`
    - included as a dependency of the main module
    - updates will be independent to the main module
    - can now possibly be used in a different monaco based editor (like Theia)
  - locators `vscode-extension-tester-locators`
    - included as a dependency of the main module
    - updates will be independent to the main module (new versions of vscode won't require upversions of the main module)
  - native handler `vscode-extension-tester-native`
    - native dialog handler is split from the main module and not included as a dependency
    - if you use native dialogs, you need to install this package to your project

### TL;DR Migration

- upversion `vscode-extension-tester` to 3.0.0, make sure `package-lock.json` is generated properly
- if you are using native dialogs, also npm install `vscode-extension-tester-native`
- API is still the same
- minor/micro updates to dependent modules can now happen without updating the main module

## 2.6.2 (April 28)

## 2.6.0 (April 16)

### New Features

- VS Code 1.44.x support

  - vscode from now on indexes quick picks starting with 0 instead of 1

  - cli now properly supports the `-t` flag for all commands, use `-t insider` to use insiders build (note that insider builds use the `x.y.z-insider` versioning scheme when choosing a version to test)
  - `Extester` API has been changed: instead of each method taking the release stream (stable/insider) as parameter, the constructor is now parametrized. This means you need a different instance for stable and insider builds when using the API
