ExTester is integrated with Mocha framework (as such requires Mocha 5.2+ to be present in your extension). To write a simple tests, one would write it just like a standard BDD Mocha test.

This is what a really simple test case might look like. Note that here we are only using pure webdriver. To use the provided page objects, see the [[Page-Object-APIs]].

For an example project, check out the [vscode-extension-tester-example](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-extension-tester-example) repository, where you can find detailed setup and usage instructions.

```typescript
import { assert } from "chai";
// import the webdriver and the high level browser wrapper
import { VSBrowser, WebDriver } from "vscode-extension-tester";

// Create a Mocha suite
describe("My Test Suite", () => {
  let browser: VSBrowser;
  let driver: WebDriver;

  // initialize the browser and webdriver
  before(async () => {
    browser = VSBrowser.instance;
    driver = browser.driver;
  });

  // test whatever we want using webdriver, here we are just checking the page title
  it("My Test Case", async () => {
    const title = await driver.getTitle();
    assert.equal(title, "whatever");
  });
});
```
