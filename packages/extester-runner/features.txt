** Settings ** 
Settings are split into two categories - View Settings and Command Line Settings
View settings:
    Exclude glob is excluding path from test file search
    Ignore Path Part removes part of string from folders (/src/test/abcd can be presented as abcd only)
    Test File Glob specifies prescription for file searching
Command Line Settings:
    Adding additional args will add this arguments to setup-and-run command
        - they're added "as it is" so it's recommended to add single quotes to paths
    Out folder is used for test execution
        - value is used to create path for running tests
        - 'out' is default value
    Root folder specifies root directory
        - may be undefinde
        - basically it's the part removed from path of .ts file while creating output .js path
    Temp Folder: 
        - if empty, default TMP_DIR location is used
        - if env. variable is set, then it's used (but this part is handled by ExTester, not by Runner!)
        - if there's path, then it's used
    VS Code type changes type used for execution
    VS Code version changes version used for execution
Logs View settings:
    Hide Empty Log Folders:
        - when active, only folders with content are showed in Logs view

** Issues **
Walkthrought is automatically showed only at first install, when extension is reinstalled, no walkthrought is showed (but it's accesible manually).

** To improve **
Configuration of root and out can be read from tsconfig.json.
